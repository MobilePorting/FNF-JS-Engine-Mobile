1.28.0;

Reverted all changes related to the Anniversary Update (Anniversary Theme is still an option for those that liked it)
New "Yeah!" Rating Popups as a reference to the Twitter/X meme
The Rendered Notes text now shows max rendered note count along with notes.length
It's now actually possible to add Custom Hitsounds
Even LESS Botplay Lag is no longer turned on by default
Enable GC is now turned on by default
Added an option to enable faster note spawning. it's untested so be warned
There are now 2 new Gameplay Modifiers so you can control the minimum and max speeds of Random Playback Rate!
The song speed will now also be affected by Random Playback Rate!
Fixed not being able to set the render gc rate to 0.0 when the engine states that's clearly an option
Fixed the playstate countdown probably starting regardless of whether or not you actually wanted the game to skip the countdown
Hopefully fixed Jack Notes being weird
Fixed a crash that could occur if you tried loading a song but had the ratingQuotes folder deleted
Probably fixed a loophole where you could crash the engine by saving songs with a difficulty name that contains spaces
